## Work Experience

* __2015 – present__  
  Junior Researcher at Laboratory of Quantum Sensors, Institute of Laser Physics SB RAS.  
### Responsibilities
  * Experimental research in the following areas: precision spectroscopy of magnesium atoms, methods of frequency stabilization, development of an optical frequency standard;
  * Development of a digital thermal stabilization system using ADC-DAC and LabVIEW and a digital system for compensating the linear frequency drift of the laser system;
  * Theoretical calculations in MatLab of the interaction of cold magnesium atoms with laser fields separated in time;
  * Writing grant applications, reports and articles;
  * Public speaking and presentation at different international conferences.

### Achivements
  * A digital two-stage system for thermal stabilization based on PID controllers using LabVIEW with an accuracy of 1 mK has been developed and implemented, which is currently used on a daily basis;
  * The frequency stability of the laser system were significantly increased due to the modernization of the laser system (by an order of magnitude, from Δν/ν = E-15 to E-16 at an averaging time of 1000 s) when it was stabilized by the clock transition in cold magnesium atoms.
