## About

I work as a junior researcher for now. In Physics, I gained expertise in theoretical and experimental research in the fields of laser physics, laser cooling, frequency standards and stabilization techniques. My research involved designing and implementing thermostabilization system based on LabVIEW and using ADC-DAC, and theoretical modeling in MatLab of laser fields interacting with cooled atoms.

While studying at the university and in work projects, programming has always attracted me, I liked to create something and immediately see the result. Therefore, I decided to change my area and switch to the frontend.

For my work and study, I programmed in C++, MatLab and the visual language G (LabVIEW). I have experience of speaking at international conferences, participating in international schools and writing articles in English and Russian.

My English level is C1. I am fond of photography and I like to ride a bike.

I studied frontend at Udemy courses, and now I am studying it at Yandex.Practicum (started in March 2021).

        return Math.max(a, b);
    });
