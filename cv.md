## About

I work as a junior researcher for now. In Physics, I gained expertise in theoretical and experimental research in the fields of laser physics, laser cooling, frequency standards and stabilization techniques. My research involved designing and implementing thermostabilization system based on LabVIEW and using ADC-DAC, and theoretical modeling in MatLab of laser fields interacting with cooled atoms.

While studying at the university and in work projects, programming has always attracted me, I liked to create something and immediately see the result. Therefore, I decided to change my area and switch to the frontend.

For my work and study, I programmed in C++, MatLab and the visual language G (LabVIEW). I have experience of speaking at international conferences, participating in international schools and writing articles in English and Russian.

My English level is C1. I am fond of photography and I like to ride a bike.

I studied frontend at Udemy courses, and now I am studying it at Yandex.Practicum (started in March 2021).

## Work Experience  

* __2013 – present__  
  Junior Researcher at Laboratory of Quantum Sensors, Institute of Laser Physics SB RAS.  

### Responsibilities:  
  * Experimental research in the following areas: precision spectroscopy of magnesium atoms, methods of frequency stabilization, development of an optical frequency standard;
  * Development of a digital thermal stabilization system using ADC-DAC and LabVIEW and a digital system for compensating the linear frequency drift of the laser system;
  * Theoretical calculations in MatLab of the interaction of cold magnesium atoms with laser fields separated in time;
  * Writing grant applications, reports and articles;
  * Public speaking and presentation at different international conferences.

### Achievements:  
  * A digital two-stage system for thermal stabilization based on PID controllers using LabVIEW with an accuracy of 1 mK has been developed and implemented, which is currently used on a daily basis;
  * The frequency stability of the laser system were significantly increased due to the modernization of the laser system (by an order of magnitude, from Δν/ν = E-15 to E-16 at an averaging time of 1000 s) when it was stabilized by the clock transition in cold magnesium atoms.
